## What is Continue?

> _Note: The `continuedev/continue` repository is no longer actively maintained and is read-only for all users._

Continue is a coding agent available as a [CLI](#cli), [VS Code extension](#vs-code), and [JetBrains plugin](#jetbrains).

## Documentation

To learn how to configure Continue, how it works, and how to customize it, check out the [Continue Docs](https://docs.continue.dev).

## Final 2.0.0 Release

We polished Continue and did a final 2.0.0 release of the VS Code extension, CLI, and JetBrains plugin.

This included removing anonymous telemetry, pulling out authentication, squashing bugs, and more.

### VS Code

### CLI

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?logo=npm&logoColor=white)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@continuedev/cli) [![View source](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_source-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white)](extensions/cli)

### JetBrains

> _Note: We recommend using the Continue CLI instead of the JetBrains plugin._

## 2.0.2

This fork lets the IDE extension apply code edits and create files without clicking Accept.

Terminal and MCP auto-run are separate toggles in Tools (and in the chat toolbar):

- **Auto-run safe terminal commands** (on by default) — typical commands such as `ls`, `git status`, and `npm test` run without confirmation. Turn it off to require Accept even for those.
- **Auto-run dangerous terminal commands** (off by default) — high-risk and destructive commands such as `curl`, `sudo`, and `rm -rf` also run without Accept. Leave it off to keep Ask First and the security block list.
- **Auto-run MCP tools** (off by default) — tools from connected MCP servers run without Accept.

A tool that is disabled in tool policies still never runs.

## Contributors

Thank you to the entire Continue community for helping us create a pioneering coding agent.

What we built together pushed the boundaries of what AI developer tooling could be.

We hope this codebase continues to serve as a foundation for others.
